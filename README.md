## <p align="center"><b>THIS ROUND'S KILLER IS... 1X1X1X1</b></p>

<p align="center">I also go by "Rex", "[The] Adversary". Any pronouns. Introject of <a href="https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Community:1x1x1x1">the Roblox myth.</a> 
<br> As well as various other iterations of 1x1x1x1, identifying most with <a href="https://forsaken2024.fandom.com/wiki/1x1x1x1">the Forsaken killer</a>. <br>
I am not particularly friendly but I will make small talk if approached. 
  <br> I use an all-caps typing quirk and speak in a manner that is somewhat archaic. <br> <br>
  I am most often only online to sit with our friends. Sometimes I will be AFK doing other things. <br>
  Whispers are the best way to reach me at these times. C + H is fine. <br>
  If you annoy me I will perma-block you. I am a hater, and the block button is my dear companion. <br>
  Fun 1x fact: every time I log on to Pony.Town someone decides they desire me. Most often carnally.<br> <br>
